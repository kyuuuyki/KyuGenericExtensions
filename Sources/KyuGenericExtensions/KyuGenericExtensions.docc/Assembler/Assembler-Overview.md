# Getting Started with Assembler

Explore the detail of the _Assembler_ and grasp how it can benefit your project. 

## Overview

Basically, the Assembler serves as the foundation for integrating various modules, transforming modularized projects into functional applications. Its primary purpose is to handle scenes and dependencies management.

The Assembler includes a Container, which acts as a repository for storing dependencies, including scenes and services. Once the container registers these dependencies, they can be conveniently retrieved whenever necessary.
